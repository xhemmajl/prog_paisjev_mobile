<h1><b>STICKMAN JUMP</b></h1>

<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
<br/>
This is a 2D game on android called "Stickman Jump". This is an attractive and simple game, all you have to do is "touch" the screen to jump and don't touch the "virus" because it loses the game. So this app is a project required by the faculty: "University of Prishtina - Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering" especially in the subject "Mobile Device Programming" in order to successfully pass the course.

I know that the quality of the code is not at the top, this is because we are students who we do not have work experience and almost the first year with Android Studio.

So this app was created by 3 students: <br> Xhemajl Kabashi <br> Valton Sherifi <br> Taulant Isaku

The application was created using the "Android Studio" tool.


I hope you like it, contact us for any problems: <br> xhemajl.kabashi@student.uni-pr.edu <br> valton.sherifi@student.uni-pr.edu <br> taulant.isaku@student.uni-pr.edu
